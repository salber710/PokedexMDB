# PokedexMDB

An application that stores information about roughly 800 Pokemon. The user can scroll and view all the Pokemon in both a linear layout and a grid layout. Additionally, there is a search bar at the top of the screen where the user can search for specific pokemon. When a Pokemon is selected by the user, a new screen pops up that has all the information regarding that Pokemon. When the user is done reading the information, they can hit the back button to go back to viewing the Pokemon.
